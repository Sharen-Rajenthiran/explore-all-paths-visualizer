# Explore All Paths Visualizer 

## Overview ⚙️
This project is a visual representation of exploring all nodes and computing the distances between the nodes. It is done through a brute-force approach to visualize the process. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides an intuitive way to understand graph traversal and distance calculations. 

## How to Use ✅
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
     `git clone https://github.com/Sharen-Rajenthiran/explore-all-paths-visualizer`.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3. Watch the animation as the algorithm explores all nodes, computing the distances.

## Future Improvements ✍🏻
1. Include different algorithms like A*.
2. Allow users to configure the number of nodes and the edge values.
3. Add an option to include only the shortest path.

# Acknowledgement 💻
I had always wanted to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to visualize algorithms but often lacked the motivation to dive in. Path-finding algorithms have always been interesting to me, so, I decided to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through this project. This project was tough, especially for a beginner, so, I sought help from coding assistants to help me complete this project. 

This project inspires me to find creative ways to learn and grow while pursuing my passions. Thank you for checking it out👋!
